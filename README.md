Voting for GitHub! RequestHub is a simple tool that uses the GitHub API to allow people to vote on features/issues for their favorite projects.

GitHub is an amazing application that adds the "missing" layer of what `git` provides out of the box, however it's scope is still limited to solving a specific problem. That said, many developers have the need for a feedback layer on top of the GitHub application. [RequestHub.io](https://requesthub.io "RequestHub.io url") provides a simple feedback mechanism without the owner of a repo having to do anything new.

In fact, [RequestHub.io](https://requesthub.io "RequestHub.io url") is available for voting, regardless of whether the owner of the repo uses it themselves personally.
